# WEBTRAX

__EXPERIMENTAL__: This repository is at a very early stage. Everything will change, don't depend on it.

## Develop + Demo

Currently using [idx.dev](https://idx.dev) to develop this project. Deploying directly into [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

To demo it on Firebase: https://webtrax-1fc7d.web.app/

To demo it on IDX: https://9000-monospace-webtrax-ng-1694359528583.cluster-lknrrkkitbcdsvoir6wqg4mwt6.cloudworkstations.dev/

## Firebase Configs

### Google API Key

The API key in [environment.ts](src/environments/environment.ts) is autogenerated by Firebase. It is a browser key, so it is "OK" for it to be checked in. However, it should be restricted to use used only in certain origins for extra security.

Namely:

1. The IDX preview domain.
2. Firebase production domain.


### Cloud Storage - CORS

Configure CORS for the cloud storage buckets to be able to download them from the browser.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/download-files#cors_configuration

```
gsutil cors set cloud_storage_cors.json gs://webtrax-1fc7d.appspot.com
```
